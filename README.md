# **Graduation Project: Arabic-to-English Language Translator**  
### 🚀 **Using Seq2Seq and Attention Mechanisms**  

This project, developed as part of the **Graduation Project for DEPI (Digital Egypt pioneers initiative)**, is an **AI-powered Arabic-to-English translator** built using a **Seq2Seq model with Attention Mechanisms**. The translator is designed to handle the complexities of the Arabic language and produce accurate English translations.

## 🌟 **Project Features**  

- **Seq2Seq with Attention:** Focuses on relevant parts of the Arabic input during translation for improved accuracy.  
- **Custom Preprocessing:** Handles Arabic text reshaping, bidirectional text processing, and special character normalization.  
- **Lightweight and Easy-to-Use:** Minimal dependencies and a straightforward implementation suitable for research and practical use.

## 🛠️ **Technologies and Dependencies**  

### **Requirements**  
All required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them with a single command:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Dependencies in `requirements.txt`**  
- **TensorFlow 2.15.0:** Deep learning framework for Seq2Seq architecture.  
- **TensorFlow Text 2.15.0:** Text processing utilities for NLP tasks.  
- **Matplotlib:** Visualization of training metrics.  
- **Scikit-Learn:** For train/test data splitting.  
- **Arabic Reshaper:** Reshapes Arabic text for better visualization.  
- **Python-Bidi:** Handles bidirectional text for proper Arabic text rendering.
